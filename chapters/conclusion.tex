\section{Conclusion}
Gaussian splatting is a promising new method for \gls{nvs} that has shown impressive results.
The core idea of the method is to go back from the continuous representation of the scene used in \gls{nerf} related methods and instead represent the scene as a discrete set of Gaussians.
While the paper, its public implementation and the shown result are impressive, we did find some areas where we believe the method could be improved.

Taking inspiration from the paper, we proposed a new path for \gls{nvs} where we leverage the power of modern hardware-accelerated ray tracing.
We believe this could be a promising path for \gls{nvs} that will synergize well with the recent development of polarization cameras.
Building a solid rendering and intersection collection framework can serve as a foundation for future research into \gls{nvs}.
