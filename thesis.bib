  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new flexible method for hand-eye calibration. The vast majority of existing hand-eye calibration techniques require a calibration rig that is used in conjunction with camera pose estimation methods. Instead, we combine structure-from-motion with known robot motions, and we show that the solution can be obtained in linear form. The latter solves for both the hand-eye parameters and the unknown scale factor inherent with structure-from-motion methods. The algebraic analysis that is made possible with such a linear formulation allows investigation of not only the well-known case of general screw motions but also of such singular motions as pure translations, pure rotations, and planar motions. In essence, the robot-mounted camera looks to an unknown rigid layout, tracks points over an image sequence, and estimates the camera-to-robot relationship. Such a self-calibration process is relevant for unmanned vehicles, robots working in remote places, and so forth. We conduct a large number of experiments that validate the quality of the method by comparing it with existing ones.},

  abstract = {Semantic Segmentation is the task of labelling every pixel in an image with a pre-defined object category. It has numerous applications in scenarios where the detailed understanding of an image is required, such as in autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis. This problem has traditionally been solved with probabilistic models known as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) due to their ability to model the relationships between the pixels being predicted. However, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently been shown to excel at a wide range of computer vision problems due to their ability to learn rich feature representations automatically from data, as opposed to traditional hand-crafted features. The idea of combining CRFs and DNNs have achieved state-of-the-art results in a number of domains. We review the literature on combining the modelling power of CRFs with the representation-learning ability of DNNs, ranging from early work that combines these two techniques as independent stages of a common pipeline to recent approaches that embed inference of probabilistic models directly in the neural network itself. Finally, we summarise future research directions.},

  abstract = {A method called, sigma-consensus, is proposed to eliminate the need for a user-defined inlier-outlier threshold in RANSAC. Instead of estimating the noise sigma, it is marginalized over a range of noise scales. The optimized model is obtained by weighted least-squares fitting where the weights come from the marginalization over sigma of the point likelihoods of being inliers. A new quality function is proposed not requiring sigma and, thus, a set of inliers to determine the model quality. Also, a new termination criterion for RANSAC is built on the proposed marginalization approach. Applying sigma-consensus, MAGSAC is proposed with no need for a user-defined sigma and improving the accuracy of robust estimation significantly. It is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of geometric accuracy on publicly available real-world datasets for epipolar geometry (F and E) and homography estimation. In addition, applying sigma-consensus only once as a post-processing step to the RANSAC output always improved the model quality on a wide range of vision problems without noticeable deterioration in processing time, adding a few milliseconds.

The contribution of the paper is the presentation of the theoretical tools, which can be applied in the analysis of many problems involving 3-D pose and point variables.},

  abstract = {Benchmark datasets that measure camera pose accuracy have driven progress in visual re-localisation research. To obtain poses for thousands of images, it is common to use a reference algorithm to generate pseudo ground truth. Popular choices include Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous-Localisation-and-Mapping (SLAM) using additional sensors like depth cameras if available. Re-localisation benchmarks thus measure how well each method replicates the results of the reference algorithm. This begs the question whether the choice of the reference algorithm favours a certain family of re-localisation methods. This paper analyzes two widely used re-localisation datasets and shows that evaluation outcomes indeed vary with the choice of the reference algorithm. We thus question common beliefs in the re-localisation literature, namely that learning-based scene coordinate regression outperforms classical feature-based methods, and that RGB-D-based methods outperform RGB-based methods. We argue that any claims on ranking re-localisation methods should take the type of the reference algorithm, and the similarity of the methods to the reference algorithm, into account.},

The system is flexible w.r.t. the amount of information available at test and at training time, catering to different applications. Input images can be RGB-D or RGB, and a 3D model of the environment can be utilized for training but is not necessary. In the minimal case, our system requires only RGB images and ground truth poses at training time, and it requires only a single RGB image at test time. The framework consists of a deep neural network and fully differentiable pose optimization. The neural network predicts so called scene coordinates, i.e. dense correspondences between the input image and 3D scene space of the environment. The pose optimization implements robust fitting of pose parameters using differentiable RANSAC (DSAC) to facilitate end-to-end training. The system, an extension of DSAC++ and referred to as DSAC*, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy an various public datasets for RGB-based re-localization, and competitive accuracy for RGB-D-based re-localization.},

In this paper we build on this group to develop a theory to associate uncertainty with extended poses represented by 5x5 matrices. Our approach is particularly suited to describe how uncertainty propagates when the extended pose represents the state of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). In particular it allows revisiting the theory of IMU preintegration on manifold and reaching a further theoretic level in this field. Exact preintegration formulas that account for rotating Earth, that is, centrifugal force and Coriolis force, are derived as a byproduct, and the factors are shown to be more accurate. The approach is validated through extensive simulations and applied to sensor-fusion where a loosely-coupled fixed-lag smoother fuses IMU and LiDAR on one hour long experiments using our experimental car. It shows how handling rotating Earth may be beneficial for long-term navigation within incremental smoothing algorithms.},

It has been observed that, to find an optimal solution (with a given probability), the number of samples drawn in ransac is significantly higher than predicted from the mathematical model. This is due to the incorrect assumption, that a model with parameters computed from an outlier-free sample is consistent with all inliers. The assumption rarely holds in practice. The locally optimized ransac makes no new assumptions about the data, on the contrary – it makes the above-mentioned assumption valid by applying local optimization to the solution estimated from the random sample.},

As compared with some current state-of-art methods, the proposed algorithm provides outperformed results in terms of both subjective and objective image quality measures},

This accessibility makes it easier for specialists in parallel programming to use GPU resources, in contrast to prior APIs like Direct3D and OpenGL, which required advanced skills in graphics programming. CUDA-powered GPUs also support programming frameworks such as OpenMP, OpenACC and OpenCL; and HIP by compiling such code to CUDA. CUDA was created by Nvidia. When it was first introduced, the name was an acronym for Compute Unified Device Architecture, but Nvidia later dropped the common use of the acronym.},

As opposed to patch-based neural networks, our fully-convolutional model operates on full-sized images and jointly computes pixel-level interest point locations and associated descriptors in one forward pass. We introduce Homographic Adaptation, a multi-scale, multi-homography approach for boosting interest point detection repeatability and performing cross-domain adaptation (e.g., synthetic-to-real). Our model, when trained on the MS-COCO generic image dataset using Homographic Adaptation, is able to repeatedly detect a much richer set of interest points than the initial pre-adapted deep model and any other traditional corner detector. The final system gives rise to state-of-the-art homography estimation results on HPatches when compared to LIFT, SIFT and ORB.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel direct sparse visual odometry formulation. It combines a fully direct probabilistic model (minimizing a photometric error) with consistent, joint optimization of all model parameters, including geometry -- represented as inverse depth in a reference frame -- and camera motion. This is achieved in real time by omitting the smoothness prior used in other direct methods and instead sampling pixels evenly throughout the images. Since our method does not depend on keypoint detectors or descriptors, it can naturally sample pixels from across all image regions that have intensity gradient, including edges or smooth intensity variations on mostly white walls. The proposed model integrates a full photometric calibration, accounting for exposure time, lens vignetting, and non-linear response functions. We thoroughly evaluate our method on three different datasets comprising several hours of video. The experiments show that the presented approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art direct and indirect methods in a variety of real-world settings, both in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract = {Recent results in monocular visual-inertial navigation (VIN) have shown that optimization-based approaches outperform filtering methods in terms of accuracy due to their capability to relinearize past states. However, the improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes. The preintegration allows us to accurately summarize hundreds of inertial measurements into a single relative motion constraint. Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group and carefully deals with uncertainty propagation. The measurements are integrated in a local frame, which eliminates the need to repeat the integration when the linearization point changes while leaving the opportunity for belated bias corrections. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated in a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, further accelerating the computation. The third contribution is an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIN pipeline: experimental results confirm that our system is very fast and demonstrates superior accuracy with respect to competitive state-of-the-art filtering and optimization algorithms, including off-the-shelf systems such as Google Tango.},

  abstract = {Current approaches for visual-inertial odometry (VIO) are able to attain highly accurate state estimation via nonlinear optimization. However, real-time optimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time, this problem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at high rate, hence leading to fast growth of the number of variables in the optimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion constraints. Our first contribution is a \textbackslash emph\{preintegration theory\} that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group. We formally discuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation noise and derive the expression for the \textbackslash emph\{maximum a posteriori\} state estimator. Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary Jacobians for the optimization and a-posteriori bias correction in analytic form. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the application of incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a \textbackslash emph\{structureless\} model for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3D points, further accelerating the computation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our monocular \textbackslash VIO pipeline on real and simulated datasets. The results confirm that our modelling effort leads to accurate state estimation in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.},

Within the technology development phase, prototype single axis gyroscopes have been realized and extensively tested for effects including temperature, acoustic and vibration sensitivities. These devices employ micro-machined all-silicon gyroscope sensor chips processed with deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). Silicon fusion bonding ensures pressures smaller than 3middot10-2 mbar. Sophisticated analog electronics and digital signal processing condition the capacitive pick-off signals and realize full closed loop operation. The current results with overall bias error smaller than 2 deg/h to 5 deg/h, scale factor error {$<$}1200 ppm, measurement range {$>$}1000 deg/s and angular random walk {$<$}0.4 radic/vh indicate that stable production of 5 deg/h gyroscopes is realistic. The fabrication technology for capacitive, pendulous accelerometer chips is based on that used for the gyros with only an increase in the enclosed pressure to obtain overcritical damping. Pulse width modulation (PWM) within a digital control loop is used to realize closed loop operation. Accelerometer chips have been tested over temperature with a residual bias error {$<$}2.0 mg and a scale factor error {$<$}1400 ppm. These sensor chips have been integrated into an IMU whereby the power budget and size of the sensor electronics have been optimized. In this paper the salient features of the gyro and accelerometer designs are presented together with an overview of the IMU system architecture. Measurement results, with a focus on environmental characteristics and robustness, are included.},

  abstract = {Modern digital cameras use specific arrangement of Color Filter Array to sample light wavelength corresponding to visible colors. The most common Color Filter Array is the Bayer filter that samples only one color per pixel. To recover the full resolution image, an interpolation algorithm can be used. This process is called demosaicing and it is one of the first processing stages of a digital imaging pipeline. We introduce a novel data-driven model for demosaicing that takes into account the different requirements for reconstruction of the image Luma and Chrominance channels. The final model is a parallel composition of two reconstruction networks with individual architecture and trained with distinct loss functions. In order to solve the overfitting problem, we prepared a dataset that contains groups of patches that share common chromatic and spectral characteristics. We reported the reconstruction error on noise-free images and measured the effect of random noise and quantization noise in the demosaicing reconstruction. To test our model performance, we implemented the network on NVIDIA Jetson Nano, obtaining an end-to-end running time of less than one second for a full frame 12 MPixel image.},

Calibration errors, such as wrong model assumptions or imprecise parameter estimation, can deteriorate a system's overall performance, making the reliable detection and quantification of these errors critical. In this work, we introduce an evaluation scheme to capture the fundamental error sources in camera calibration: systematic errors (biases) and uncertainty (variance). The proposed bias detection method uncovers smallest systematic errors and thereby reveals imperfections of the calibration setup and provides the basis for camera model selection. A novel resampling-based uncertainty estimator enables uncertainty estimation under non-ideal conditions and thereby extends the classical covariance estimator. Furthermore, we derive a simple uncertainty metric that is independent of the camera model. In combination, the proposed methods can be used to assess the accuracy of individual calibrations, but also to benchmark new calibration algorithms, camera models, or calibration setups. We evaluate the proposed methods with simulations and real cameras.},

It is intended for storage of floating-point values in applications where higher precision is not essential, in particular image processing and neural networks. Almost all modern uses follow the IEEE 754-2008 standard, where the 16-bit base-2 format is referred to as binary16, and the exponent uses 5 bits. This can express values in the range ±65,504, with the minimum value above 1 being 1 + 1/1024. Depending on the computer, half-precision can be over an order of magnitude faster than double precision, e.g. 550 PFLOPS for half-precision vs 37 PFLOPS for double precision on one cloud provider.},

  abstract = {With the growing importance of deep learning and energy-saving approximate computing, half precision floating point arithmetic (FP16) is fast gaining popularity. Nvidia’s recent Pascal architecture was the first GPU that offered FP16 support. However, when actual products were shipped, programmers soon realized that a na¨ıve replacement of single precision (FP32) code with half precision led to disappointing performance results, even if they are willing to tolerate the increase in error precision reduction brings. In this paper, we developed an automated conversion framework to help users migrate their CUDA code to better exploit Pascal’s half precision capability. Using our tools and techniques, we successfully convert many benchmarks from single precision arithmetic to half precision equivalent, and achieved significant speedup improvement in many cases. In the best case, a 3× speedup over the FP32 version was achieved. We shall also discuss some new issues and opportunities that the Pascal GPUs brought.},

  abstract = {JPEG ( JAY-peg) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality. Since its introduction in 1992, JPEG has been the most widely used image compression standard in the world, and the most widely used digital image format, with several billion JPEG images produced every day as of 2015.The term "JPEG" is an acronym for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, which created the standard in 1992. JPEG was largely responsible for the proliferation of digital images and digital photos across the Internet, and later social media.JPEG compression is used in a number of image file formats. JPEG/Exif is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other photographic image capture devices; along with JPEG/JFIF, it is the most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images on the World Wide Web. These format variations are often not distinguished, and are simply called JPEG. The MIME media type for JPEG is image/jpeg, except in older Internet Explorer versions, which provides a MIME type of image/pjpeg when uploading JPEG images. JPEG files usually have a filename extension of .jpg or .jpeg. JPEG/JFIF supports a maximum image size of 65,535×65,535 pixels, hence up to 4 gigapixels for an aspect ratio of 1:1. In 2000, the JPEG group introduced a format intended to be a successor, JPEG 2000, but it was unable to replace the original JPEG as the dominant image standard.},

  urldate = {2023-05-16},
  abstract = {The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components. A full kernel controls all hardware resources (e.g. I/O, memory, cryptography) via device drivers, arbitrates conflicts between processes concerning such resources, and optimizes the utilization of common resources e.g. CPU \& cache usage, file systems, and network sockets. On most systems, the kernel is one of the first programs loaded on startup (after the bootloader). It handles the rest of startup as well as memory, peripherals, and input/output (I/O) requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit. The critical code of the kernel is usually loaded into a separate area of memory, which is protected from access by application software or other less critical parts of the operating system. The kernel performs its tasks, such as running processes, managing hardware devices such as the hard disk, and handling interrupts, in this protected kernel space. In contrast, application programs such as browsers, word processors, or audio or video players  use a separate area of memory, user space. This separation prevents user data and kernel data from interfering with each other and causing instability and slowness, as well as preventing malfunctioning applications from affecting other applications or crashing the entire operating system. Even in systems where the kernel is included in application address spaces, memory protection is used to prevent unauthorized applications from modifying the kernel. The kernel's interface is a low-level abstraction layer. When a process requests a service from the kernel, it must invoke a system call, usually through a wrapper function. There are different kernel architecture designs. Monolithic kernels run entirely in a single address space with the CPU executing in supervisor mode, mainly for speed. Microkernels run most but not all of their services in user space, like user processes do, mainly for resilience and modularity. MINIX 3 is a notable example of microkernel design. Instead, the Linux kernel is monolithic, although it is also modular, for it can insert and remove loadable kernel modules at runtime. This central component of a computer system is responsible for executing programs. The kernel takes responsibility for deciding at any time which of the many running programs should be allocated to the processor or processors.},

In National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) mast camera (Mastcam) imaging system, onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity, a Bayer pattern filter is being used to capture the RGB (red, green, and blue) color of scenes on Mars. The Mastcam has two cameras: left and right. The right camera has three times better resolution than that of the left. It is well known that demosaicing introduces color and zipper artifacts. Here, we present a comparative study of demosaicing results using conventional and deep learning algorithms. Sixteen left and 15 right Mastcam images were used in our experiments. Due to a lack of ground truth images for Mastcam data from Mars, we compared the various algorithms using a blind image quality assessment model. It was observed that no one algorithm can work the best for all images. In particular, a deep learning-based algorithm worked the best for the right Mastcam images and a conventional algorithm achieved the best results for the left Mastcam images. Moreover, subjective evaluation of five demosaiced Mastcam images was also used to compare the various algorithms.},

It considers the ability of rods to reliably signal the arrival of individual photons of light, as well as the ability of the retina to process these single-photon signals, and it discusses the advantages that accrue. Drawbacks in the arrangement, including the very slow dark adaptation of scotopic vision, are also considered. Finally, the timing of the evolution of cone and rod photoreceptors, the retina, and the camera-style eye is summarised.},

  abstract = {Color-polarization filter array (CPFA) sensors are able to capture linear polarization and color information in a single shot. For a scene that contains a high dynamic range of irradiance and polarization signatures, some pixel values approach the saturation and noise levels of the sensor. The most common CPFA configuration is overdetermined, and contains four different linear polarization analyzers. Assuming that not all pixel responses are equally reliable in CPFA channels, one can therefore apply the high dynamic range imaging scheme to improve the Stokes estimation from a single CPFA image. Here I present this alternative methodology and show qualitative and quantitative results on real data.},

Stokes imaging permits to estimate polarization of light and create multiple polarization descriptors of the scene. Therefore, such video cameras need fast processing for critical applications like overseeing, defect detection or surface characterization. A field-programmable gate array hardware implementation of Stokes processing is presented here that embeds dedicated pipeline for micropolarizer array sensors. An optimized fixed-point pipeline is used to compute polarimetric images, ie, Stokes vector, degree of polarization, and angle of polarization. Simulation and experimental studies are done. The hardware design contains parallel processing, low latency, and low power and could meet actual real-time and embeddable requirements for smart camera systems.},

Improvements of the LO-RANSAC procedure are proposed: a use of truncated quadratic cost function, an introduction of a limit on the number of inliers used for the least squares computation and several implementation issues are addressed. The implementation is made publicly available. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the novel algorithm called LO + -RANSAC is (1) very stable (almost non-random in nature), (2) very precise in a broad range of con-ditions, (3) less sensitive to the choice of inlier-outlier threshold and (4) it offers a sig-nificantly better starting point for bundle adjustment than the Gold Standard method advocated in the Hartley-Zisserman book.},

  abstract = {Image demosaicing is a problem of interpolating full-resolution color images from so-called color-filter-array (CFA) samples. Among various CFA patterns, Bayer pattern has been the most popular choice and demosaicing of Bayer pattern has attracted renewed interest in recent years partially due to the increased availability of source codes/executables in response to the principle of "reproducible research". In this article, we provide a systematic survey of over seventy published works in this field since 1999 (complementary to previous reviews\textsuperscript{22, 67}). Our review attempts to address important issues to demosaicing and identify fundamental differences among competing approaches. Our findings suggest most existing works belong to the class of sequential demosaicing - i.e., luminance channel is interpolated first and then chrominance channels are reconstructed based on recovered luminance information. We report our comparative study results with a collection of eleven competing algorithms whose source codes or executables are provided by the authors. Our comparison is performed on two data sets: Kodak PhotoCD (popular choice) and IMAX high-quality images (more challenging). While most existing demosaicing algorithms achieve good performance on the Kodak data set, their performance on the IMAX one (images with varying-hue and high-saturation edges) degrades significantly. Such observation suggests the importance of properly addressing the issue of mismatch between assumed model and observation data in demosaicing, which calls for further investigation on issues such as model validation, test data selection and performance evaluation.},

  abstract = {Single-sensor digital cameras capture imagery by covering the sensor surface with a color filter array (CFA) such that each sensor pixel only samples one of three primary color values. To render a full-color image, an interpolation process, commonly referred to as CFA demosaicking, is required to estimate the other two missing color values at each pixel. In this paper, we present two contributions to the CFA demosaicking: a new and improved CFA demosaicking method for producing high quality color images and new image measures for quantifying the performance of demosaicking methods. The proposed demosaicking method consists of two successive steps: an interpolation step that estimates missing color values by exploiting spatial and spectral correlations among neighboring pixels, and a post-processing step that suppresses noticeable demosaicking artifacts by adaptive median filtering. Moreover, in recognition of the limitations of current image measures, we propose two types of image measures to quantify the performance of different demosaicking methods; the first type evaluates the fidelity of demosaicked images by computing the peak signal-to-noise ratio and CIELAB /spl utri/E/sup *//sub ab/ for edge and smooth regions separately, and the second type accounts for one major demosaicking artifact-zipper effect. We gauge the proposed demosaicking method and image measures using several existing methods as benchmarks, and demonstrate their efficacy using a variety of test images.},

We follow an analysis-by-synthesis framework, inspired by recent work that models scenes as a collection of 3D Gaussians which are optimized to reconstruct input images via differentiable rendering. To model dynamic scenes, we allow Gaussians to move and rotate over time while enforcing that they have persistent color, opacity, and size. By regularizing Gaussians' motion and rotation with local-rigidity constraints, we show that our Dynamic 3D Gaussians correctly model the same area of physical space over time, including the rotation of that space. Dense 6-DOF tracking and dynamic reconstruction emerges naturally from persistent dynamic view synthesis, without requiring any correspondence or flow as input. We demonstrate a large number of downstream applications enabled by our representation, including first-person view synthesis, dynamic compositional scene synthesis, and 4D video editing.},

SymForce provides geometry and camera types, Lie group operations, and branchless singularity handling for creating and analyzing complex symbolic expressions in Python, built on top of SymPy. Generated functions can be integrated as factors into our tangent-space nonlinear optimizer, which is highly optimized for real-time production use. We introduce novel methods to automatically compute tangent-space Jacobians, eliminating the need for bug-prone handwritten derivatives. This workflow enables faster runtime code, faster development time, and fewer lines of handwritten code versus the state-of-the-art. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can yield order of magnitude speedups on computational tasks core to robotics. Code is available at https://github.com/symforce-org/symforce.},

A provably optimal model verification strategy is designed for the situation when the contamination of data by outliers is known, i.e. the algorithm is the fastest possible (on average) of all randomized RANSAC algorithms guaranteeing 1 - n confidence in the solution. The derivation of the optimality property is based on Wald's theory of sequential decision making. The R-RANSAC with SPRT which does not require the a priori knowledge of the fraction of outliers and has results close to the optimal strategy is introduced. We show experimentally that on standard test data the method is 2 to 10 times faster than the standard RANSAC and up to 4 times faster than previously published methods.},

It is two to three times faster than a straightforward GPU implementation of the same algorithm on many GPUs. Most of the optimizations are applicable to other kinds of processors that support SIMD instructions, like CPUs and DSPs. Source code is available online.},

However, despite of using sophisticated rigidity assumptions and parametrizations, such networks are typically limited to only two frame pairs which does not allow them to exploit temporal information. In our paper we address this shortcoming by proposing a novel multi-frame approach that considers an additional preceding stereo pair. To this end, we proceed in two steps: Firstly, building upon the recent RAFT-3D approach, we develop an improved two-frame baseline by incorporating an advanced stereo method. Secondly, and even more importantly, exploiting the specific modeling concepts of RAFT-3D, we propose a U-Net architecture that performs a fusion of forward and backward flow estimates and hence allows to integrate temporal information on demand. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark do not only show that the advantages of the improved baseline and the temporal fusion approach complement each other, they also demonstrate that the computed scene flow is highly accurate. More precisely, our approach ranks second overall and first for the even more challenging foreground objects, in total outperforming the original RAFT-3D method by more than 16\%.

In this scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementations in modern operating systems, using secondary storage to let programs exceed the size of available physical memory. For simplicity, main memory is called "RAM" (an acronym of random-access memory) and secondary storage is called "disk" (a shorthand for hard disk drive, drum memory or solid-state drive, etc.), but as with many aspects of computing, the concepts are independent of the technology used. Depending on the memory model, paged memory functionality is usually hardwired into a CPU/MCU by using a Memory Management Unit (MMU) or Memory Protection Unit (MPU) and separately enabled by privileged system code in the operating system's kernel. In CPUs implementing the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) for instance, the memory paging is enabled via the CR0 control register.},

  abstract = {Snapshot polarization imaging has gained interest in the last few decades. Recent research and technology achievements defined the polarization Filter Array (PFA). It is dedicated to division-of-focal plane polarimeters, which permits to analyze the direction of light electric field oscillation. Its filters form a mosaicked pattern, in which each pixel only senses a fraction of the total polarization states, so the other missing polarization states have to be interpolated. As for Color or Spectral Filter Arrays (CFA or SFA), several dedicated demosaicking methods exist in the PFA literature. Such methods are mainly based on spatial correlation disregarding inter-channel correlation. We show that polarization channels are strongly correlated in images. We therefore propose to extend some demosaicking methods from CFA/SFA to PFA, and compare them with those that are PFA-oriented. Objective and subjective analysis show that the pseudo panchromatic image difference method provides the best results and can be used as benchmark for PFA demosaicking.},

  abstract = {We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location \$(x,y,z)\$ and viewing direction \$(\textbackslash theta, \textbackslash phi)\$) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons.},

  abstract = {This paper presents VTN, a transformer-based framework for video recognition. Inspired by recent developments in vision transformers, we ditch the standard approach in video action recognition that relies on 3D ConvNets and introduce a method that classifies actions by attending to the entire video sequence information. Our approach is generic and builds on top of any given 2D spatial network. In terms of wall runtime, it trains \$16.1\textbackslash times\$ faster and runs \$5.1\textbackslash times\$ faster during inference while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods. It enables whole video analysis, via a single end-to-end pass, while requiring \$1.5\textbackslash times\$ fewer GFLOPs. We report competitive results on Kinetics-400 and present an ablation study of VTN properties and the trade-off between accuracy and inference speed. We hope our approach will serve as a new baseline and start a fresh line of research in the video recognition domain.

A division-of-focal-plane polarimeter is a promising approach to capture the polarization images of different orientations in one shot, while it requires color-polarization demosaicking. In this paper, we propose a two-step color-polarization demosaicking network\textasciitilde (TCPDNet), which consists of two sub-tasks of color demosaicking and polarization demosaicking. We also introduce a reconstruction loss in the YCbCr color space to improve the performance of TCPDNet. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that TCPDNet outperforms existing methods in terms of the image quality of polarization images and the accuracy of Stokes parameters.},

  abstract = {The recent breakthroughs in natural language processing for model pretraining on large quantities of data have opened the way for similar foundation models in computer vision. These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by producing all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning. This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021) on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels.},

This optimizes a photometric cost term based on the Lucas-Kanade method. Many recent works use the brightness constancy assumption in the alignment cost formulation and therefore cannot cope with significant illumination changes. Such changes are especially likely to occur for loop closures in SLAM. Alternatives exist which attempt to match images more robustly. In our paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of real-time capable methods. We determine their accuracy and robustness in the context of odometry and of loop closures, both on real images as well as synthetic datasets with simulated lighting changes. We find that for real images, a Census-based method outperforms the others. We make our new datasets available online.},

  abstract = {The demand for multimodal sensing systems for robotics is growing due to the increase in robustness, reliability and accuracy offered by these systems. These systems also need to be spatially and temporally co-registered to be effective. In this paper, we propose a targetless and structureless spatiotemporal camera-LiDAR calibration method. Our method combines a closed-form solution with a modified structureless bundle adjustment where the coarse-to-fine approach does not \{require\} an initial guess on the spatiotemporal parameters. Also, as 3D features (structure) are calculated from triangulation only, there is no need to have a calibration target or to match 2D features with the 3D point cloud which provides flexibility in the calibration process and sensor configuration. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method through both simulation and real data experiments using multiple sensor payload configurations mounted to hand-held, aerial and legged robot systems. Also, qualitative results are given in the form of a colorized point cloud visualization.},

When classical localization devices failed (e.g. GPS sensor in cluttered environments), aforementioned data could be used within a localization framework. This is called Visual Based Localization (VBL). Due to numerous data types that can be collected from a scene, VBL encompasses a large amount of different methods. This paper presents a survey about recent methods that localize a visual acquisition system according to a known environment. We start by categorizing VBL methods into two distinct families: indirect and direct localization systems. As the localization environment is almost always dynamic, we pay special attention to methods designed to handle appearances changes occurring in a scene. Thereafter, we highlight methods exploiting heterogeneous types of data. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion on promising trends that could permit to a localization system to reach high precision pose estimation within an area as large as possible.},

  abstract = {Polarization (also polarisation) is a property of transverse waves which specifies the geometrical orientation of the oscillations.  In a transverse wave, the direction of the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the wave.  A simple example of a polarized transverse wave is vibrations traveling along a taut string (see image); for example, in a musical instrument like a guitar string. Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string.  In contrast, in longitudinal waves, such as sound waves in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization.  Transverse waves that exhibit polarization include electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves, gravitational waves, and transverse sound waves (shear waves) in solids. An electromagnetic wave such as light consists of a coupled oscillating electric field and magnetic field which are always perpendicular to each other; by convention, the "polarization" of electromagnetic waves refers to the direction of the electric field.  In linear polarization, the fields oscillate in a single direction.  In circular or elliptical polarization, the fields rotate at a constant rate in a plane as the wave travels, either in the right-hand or in the left-hand direction. Light or other electromagnetic radiation from many sources, such as the sun, flames, and incandescent lamps, consists of short wave trains with an equal mixture of polarizations; this is called unpolarized light.  Polarized light can be produced by passing unpolarized light through a polarizer, which allows waves of only one polarization to pass through. The most common optical materials do not affect the polarization of light, but some materials—those that exhibit birefringence, dichroism, or optical activity—affect light differently depending on its polarization.  Some of these are used to make polarizing filters.  Light also becomes partially polarized when it reflects at an angle from a surface. According to quantum mechanics, electromagnetic waves can also be viewed as streams of particles called photons.  When viewed in this way, the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is determined by a quantum mechanical property of photons called their spin.  A photon has one of two possible spins: it can either spin in a right hand sense or a left hand sense about its direction of travel. Circularly polarized electromagnetic waves are composed of photons with only one type of spin, either right- or left-hand.  Linearly polarized waves consist of photons that are in a superposition of right and left circularly polarized states, with equal amplitude and phases synchronized to give oscillation in a plane.Polarization is an important parameter in areas of science dealing with transverse waves, such as optics, seismology, radio, and microwaves. Especially impacted are technologies such as lasers, wireless and optical fiber telecommunications, and radar.},

They have been used extensively in object reconstruction, inspection, medical application, and localization of mobile robotics. We focus on mobile robotics applications in which point clouds are to be registered. While the underlying principle of those algorithms is simple, many variations have been proposed for many different applications. In this review, we give a historical perspective of the registration problem and show that the plethora of solutions can be organized and differentiated according to a few elements. Accordingly, we present a formalization of geometric registration and cast algorithms proposed in the literature into this framework. Finally, we review a few applications of this framework in mobile robotics that cover different kinds of platforms, environments, and tasks. These examples allow us to study the specific requirements of each use case and the necessary configuration choices leading to the registration implementation. Ultimately, the objective of this review is to provide guidelines for the choice of geometric registration configuration.},

Adapting this approach to 3D synthesis would require large-scale datasets of labeled 3D data and efficient architectures for denoising 3D data, neither of which currently exist. In this work, we circumvent these limitations by using a pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion model to perform text-to-3D synthesis. We introduce a loss based on probability density distillation that enables the use of a 2D diffusion model as a prior for optimization of a parametric image generator. Using this loss in a DeepDream-like procedure, we optimize a randomly-initialized 3D model (a Neural Radiance Field, or NeRF) via gradient descent such that its 2D renderings from random angles achieve a low loss. The resulting 3D model of the given text can be viewed from any angle, relit by arbitrary illumination, or composited into any 3D environment. Our approach requires no 3D training data and no modifications to the image diffusion model, demonstrating the effectiveness of pretrained image diffusion models as priors.},

However, application of computer vision techniques in maritime domain received attention only recently. The maritime environment offers its own unique requirements and challenges. Assessment of the quality of detections is a fundamental need in computer vision. However, the conventional assessment metrics suitable for usual object detection are deficient in the maritime setting. Thus, a large body of related work in computer vision appears inapplicable to the maritime setting at the first sight. We discuss the problem of defining assessment metrics suitable for maritime computer vision. We consider new bottom edge proximity metrics as assessment metrics for maritime computer vision. These metrics indicate that existing computer vision approaches are indeed promising for maritime computer vision and can play a foundational role in the emerging field of maritime computer vision.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.},

  abstract = {A computational problem that arises frequently in computer vision is that of estimating the parameters of a model from data that have been contaminated by noise and outliers. More generally, any practical system that seeks to estimate quantities from noisy data measurements must have at its core some means of dealing with data contamination. The random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is one of the most popular tools for robust estimation. Recent years have seen an explosion of activity in this area, leading to the development of a number of techniques that improve upon the efficiency and robustness of the basic RANSAC algorithm. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of recent research in RANSAC-based robust estimation by analyzing and comparing various approaches that have been explored over the years. We provide a common context for this analysis by introducing a new framework for robust estimation, which we call Universal RANSAC (USAC). USAC extends the simple hypothesize-and-verify structure of standard RANSAC to incorporate a number of important practical and computational considerations. In addition, we provide a general-purpose C++ software library that implements the USAC framework by leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms for the various modules. This implementation thus addresses many of the limitations of standard RANSAC within a single unified package. We benchmark the performance of the algorithm on a large collection of estimation problems. The implementation we provide can be used by researchers either as a stand-alone tool for robust estimation or as a benchmark for evaluating new techniques.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are often tasked to explore unseen environments, aiming to acquire and understand large amounts of visual image data and other sensory information. In such scenarios, remote sensing data may be available a priori, and can help to build a semantic model of the environment and plan future autonomous missions. In this paper, we introduce two multimodal learning algorithms to model the relationship between visual images taken by an autonomous underwater vehicle during a survey and remotely sensed acoustic bathymetry (ocean depth) data that is available prior to the survey. We present a multi-layer architecture to capture the joint distribution between the bathymetry and visual modalities. We then propose an extension based on gated feature learning models, which allows the model to cluster the input data in an unsupervised fashion and predict visual image features using just the ocean depth information. Our experiments demonstrate that multimodal learning improves semantic classification accuracy regardless of which modalities are available at classification time, allows for unsupervised clustering of either or both modalities, and can facilitate mission planning by enabling class-based or image-based queries.},

It includes methods of encoding 525-line 60 Hz and 625-line 50 Hz signals, both with an active region covering 720 luminance samples and 360 chrominance samples per line. The color encoding system is known as YCbCr 4:2:2. The Rec. 601 video raster format has been re-used in a number of later standards, including the ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T H.26x compressed formats, although compressed formats for consumer applications usually use chroma subsampling reduced from the 4:2:2 sampling specified in Rec. 601 to 4:2:0. The standard has been revised several times in its history. Its seventh edition, referred to as BT.601-7, was approved in March 2011 and was formally published in October 2011.},

  abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

  abstract = {It is often assumed that the driving force behind autonomous ship discussions is reduction in crew cost or societal concerns like improved maritime safety due to reduction in human errors, better working conditions for crew in land-based control centers, or sustainability goals achieved through higher efficiency and lower emissions. But in assessing actual projects that are underway other factors also stand out. For the container ship Yara Birkeland, for example, the major drivers were reduction in local truck transport through urban areas and the realizing of a completely green electric transport. For ASKO cargo ferries, improved reliability of their inter-warehouse transport was a significant additional factor. This chapter will discuss possible societal benefits and potential drawbacks of autonomous ships, as presented in literature as well as from our own research particularly from the European Union (EU) projects Advanced, Efficient and Green Intermodal Systems (AEGIS) and Autonomous Shipping Initiative for European Waters (AUTOSHIP), and the Norwegian project “Smartere Transport”. The focus is on cargo transport, but some concerns for passenger transport will also be explored. The analysis is mostly qualitative, but some quantitative key performance indicators (KPI) will be proposed. The perspective is mainly Norwegian, a society with a high living standard and a sparsely populated nation, where advanced ship technology is a necessary part of life and in general positively regarded. Nevertheless, many of the observations are deemed highly applicable to other countries and regions.},

It remains, however, a challenging task, particularly for large-scale environments and in presence of significant appearance changes. State-of-the-art methods not only struggle with such scenarios, but are often too resource intensive for certain real-time applications. In this paper we propose HF-Net, a hierarchical localization approach based on a monolithic CNN that simultaneously predicts local features and global descriptors for accurate 6-DoF localization. We exploit the coarse-to-fine localization paradigm: we first perform a global retrieval to obtain location hypotheses and only later match local features within those candidate places. This hierarchical approach incurs significant runtime savings and makes our system suitable for real-time operation. By leveraging learned descriptors, our method achieves remarkable localization robustness across large variations of appearance and sets a new state-of-the-art on two challenging benchmarks for large-scale localization.},

Assignments are estimated by solving a differentiable optimal transport problem, whose costs are predicted by a graph neural network. We introduce a flexible context aggregation mechanism based on attention, enabling SuperGlue to reason about the underlying 3D scene and feature assignments jointly. Compared to traditional, hand-designed heuristics, our technique learns priors over geometric transformations and regularities of the 3D world through end-to-end training from image pairs. SuperGlue outperforms other learned approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on the task of pose estimation in challenging real-world indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method performs matching in real-time on a modern GPU and can be readily integrated into modern SfM or SLAM systems.

  abstract = {Visual localization is the task of accurate camera pose estimation in a known scene. It is a key problem in computer vision and robotics, with applications including self-driving cars, Structure-from-Motion, SLAM, and Mixed Reality. Traditionally, the localization problem has been tackled using 3D geometry. Recently, end-to-end approaches based on convolutional neural networks have become popular. These methods learn to directly regress the camera pose from an input image. However, they do not achieve the same level of pose accuracy as 3D structure-based methods. To understand this behavior, we develop a theoretical model for camera pose regression. We use our model to predict failure cases for pose regression techniques and verify our predictions through experiments. We furthermore use our model to show that pose regression is more closely related to pose approximation via image retrieval than to accurate pose estimation via 3D structure. A key result is that current approaches do not consistently outperform a handcrafted image retrieval baseline. This clearly shows that additional research is needed before pose regression algorithms are ready to compete with structure-based methods.},

  abstract = {Camera calibration is an essential first step in setting up 3D Computer Vision systems. Commonly used parametric camera models are limited to a few degrees of freedom and thus often do not optimally fit to complex real lens distortion. In contrast, generic camera models allow for very accurate calibration due to their flexibility. Despite this, they have seen little use in practice. In this paper, we argue that this should change. We propose a calibration pipeline for generic models that is fully automated, easy to use, and can act as a drop-in replacement for parametric calibration, with a focus on accuracy. We compare our results to parametric calibrations. Considering stereo depth estimation and camera pose estimation as examples, we show that the calibration error acts as a bias on the results. We thus argue that in contrast to current common practice, generic models should be preferred over parametric ones whenever possible. To facilitate this, we released our calibration pipeline at https://github.com/puzzlepaint/camera\_calibration, making both easy-to-use and accurate camera calibration available to everyone.},

  abstract = {A Lie group is an old mathematical abstract object dating back to the XIX century, when mathematician Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. As it often happens, its usage has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the fields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difficult to understand and to use. This may be due to the fact that most of the literature on Lie theory is written by and for mathematicians and physicists, who might be more used than us to the deep abstractions this theory deals with. In estimation for robotics it is often not necessary to exploit the full capacity of the theory, and therefore an effort of selection of materials is required. In this paper, we will walk through the most basic principles of the Lie theory, with the aim of conveying clear and useful ideas, and leave a significant corpus of the Lie theory behind. Even with this mutilation, the material included here has proven to be extremely useful in modern estimation algorithms for robotics, especially in the fields of SLAM, visual odometry, and the like. Alongside this micro Lie theory, we provide a chapter with a few application examples, and a vast reference of formulas for the major Lie groups used in robotics, including most jacobian matrices and the way to easily manipulate them. We also present a new C++ template-only library implementing all the functionality described here.},

They were defined by George Gabriel Stokes in 1852, as a mathematically convenient alternative to the more common description of incoherent or partially polarized radiation in terms of its total intensity (I), (fractional) degree of polarization (p), and the shape parameters of the polarization ellipse. The effect of an optical system on the polarization of light can be determined by constructing the Stokes vector for the input light and applying Mueller calculus, to obtain the Stokes vector of the light leaving the system. The original Stokes paper was discovered independently by Francis Perrin in 1942 and by Subrahamanyan Chandrasekhar in 1947, who named it as the Stokes parameters.},

  title = {A {{Camera-based Perception System}} for {{Autonomous Quadcopter Landing}} on a {{Marine Vessel}}},
  author = {Sundvoll, Thomas},
  abstract = {Små, ubemannede luftfartøyer (UAVer) har tiltrukket seg mye oppmerksomhet de siste årene, og et av de mest studerte UAVene er quadcopteret. Et quadcopter går også under kategorien VTOL-fartøy som er et begrep som brukes om fartøy som kan ta av og lande vertikalt. Dette gjør at quadcoptere har en fordel når de opererer i områder med lite plass. Sammen med deres høye manøvrerbarhet er de et godt vertøy til å utføre mange oppgaver, slik som inspeksjon, transport av små pakker og overvåkning for søk- og redningsopperasjoner. For å øke flygetiden og redusere kostnadene ved å manuelt styre slike fartøy, er det i det siste forsket mye på autonome quadcoptre. Deler av en autonom flytur, og særlig landingen, krever et presist posisjonsestimat. Denne oppgaven undersøker et bruksområde hvor landingsplassen er betydelig begrenset når det kommer til størrelse, nemlig å lande på et lite, sjøgående fartøy. I dette tilfellet kan landingsplassen være omtrent på samme størrelse som quadcopteret selv, noe som krever et posisjonsestimat med enda høyere presisjon. I dette tilfellet vil ikke vanlige GPS-målinger være presist nok til å utføre autonom landing. Derfor undersøker denne oppgaven bruken av kamera som hovedsensor å estimere posisjonen til et quadcopter, med forventning om at dette vil gi et bedre estimat. En landingsplattform er designet og bygget for å fungere som landingsplass i eksperimentene. Den er designet for å etterligne en standard landingsplattform som vanligvis er å finne på sjøgående fartøy og marine installasjoner. Fartøyet som til slutt vil bruke landingsplattformen er modellskipet ReVolt som er laget av DNV GL, så designet er tilpasset for at landingsplattformen skal passe til dette spesifikke skipet. Et datasyn-system er utviklet med hovedhensikt å estimere quadcopterets posisjon relativt til landingsplattformen. Hovedutfordringen med et datasyn-system på sjøen er mangelen på faste punkter å navigere etter, siden sjøen er i konstant bevegelse. For å løse dette problemet er tradisjonelle datasyn-metoder brukt, blant annet fargesegmentering, deteksjon av kanter og deteksjon av hjørner, for å hente ut allerede kjente kjennetegn på landingsplattformen. Ut fra dette er posisjonen estimert ved bruk av hullkamera-modellen og kjente mål på landingsplattformen. Metodene og algoritmene for posisjonsestimatet er utviklet ved bruk av OpenCV-biblioteket i Python, og datasyn-systemet er integrert inn i rammeverket Robot Operating System (ROS). I tillegg er en bestikkregning-modul utviklet for å gi et estimat basert på interne målinger hos quadcopteret, for bruk når ingen datasyn-estimat er tilgjengelig. Systemet er testet både i en simulator og med et fysisk quadcopter og landingsplattform, med nøyaktige resultat i simulatoren og lovende, men støyfulle resultat med det fysiske quadcopteret. Til slutt er det gitt noen forslag til forbedringer av metodene og fremtidig arbeid på temaet.},

  abstract = {Robot-world, hand-eye calibration is the problem of determining the transformation between the robot end-effector and a camera, as well as the transformation between the robot base and the world coordinate system. This relationship has been modeled as \$\textbackslash mathbf\{AX\}=\textbackslash mathbf\{ZB\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mathbf\{X\}\$ and \$\textbackslash mathbf\{Z\}\$ are unknown homogeneous transformation matrices. The successful execution of many robot manipulation tasks depends on determining these matrices accurately, and we are particularly interested in the use of calibration for use in vision tasks. In this work, we describe a collection of methods consisting of two cost function classes, three different parameterizations of rotation components, and separable versus simultaneous formulations. We explore the behavior of this collection of methods on real datasets and simulated datasets, and compare to seven other state-of-the-art methods. Our collection of methods return greater accuracy on many metrics as compared to the state-of-the-art. The collection of methods is extended to the problem of robot-world hand-multiple-eye calibration, and results are shown with two and three cameras mounted on the same robot.},

  abstract = {Even though Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are increasingly used to perform various laborious and expensive offshore tasks, they still require an extensive dedicated crew supporting and ensuring the safety of their operations. The recent developments in computer vision and robotics further fueled the interest on developing autonomous USVs that will overcome the aforementioned limitations, unleashing their full potential. One of the most vital and fundamental tasks in order to automate and ensure the safety of USV operations is to perform water segmentation. Despite the importance of developing such segmentation methods, there is a lack of highresolution publicly available datasets, which are suitable for training and evaluating deep learning methods. The main contribution of this paper is collecting, annotating and releasing a publicly available high-resolution dataset for developing deep learning algorithms for water segmentation in a Nordic lake environment. Furthermore, we adapt a deep learning algorithm previously applied for road segmentation to the water segmentation task. While the algorithm obtains a high accuracy, the results also allow for identifying critical limitations of the approach. Finally, we propose and evaluate a novel lightweight fully convolutional neural network architecture, fully adapted to the needs of water segmentation from highresolution images.},

  abstract = {Visual localization in large and complex indoor scenes, dominated by weakly textured rooms and repeating geometric patterns, is a challenging problem with high practical relevance for applications such as Augmented Reality and robotics. To handle the ambiguities arising in this scenario, a common strategy is, first, to generate multiple estimates for the camera pose from which a given query image was taken. The pose with the largest geometric consistency with the query image, e.g., in the form of an inlier count, is then selected in a second stage. While a significant amount of research has concentrated on the first stage, there is considerably less work on the second stage. In this paper, we thus focus on pose verification. We show that combining different modalities, namely appearance, geometry, and semantics, considerably boosts pose verification and consequently pose accuracy. We develop multiple hand-crafted as well as a trainable approach to join into the geometric-semantic verification and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art on a very challenging indoor dataset.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing photo-realistic images and videos is at the heart of computer graphics and has been the focus of decades of research. Traditionally, synthetic images of a scene are generated using rendering algorithms such as rasterization or ray tracing, which take specifically defined representations of geometry and material properties as input. Collectively, these inputs define the actual scene and what is rendered, and are referred to as the scene representation (where a scene consists of one or more objects). Example scene representations are triangle meshes with accompanied textures (e.g., created by an artist), point clouds (e.g., from a depth sensor), volumetric grids (e.g., from a CT scan), or implicit surface functions (e.g., truncated signed distance fields). The reconstruction of such a scene representation from observations using differentiable rendering losses is known as inverse graphics or inverse rendering. Neural rendering is closely related, and combines ideas from classical computer graphics and machine learning to create algorithms for synthesizing images from real-world observations. Neural rendering is a leap forward towards the goal of synthesizing photo-realistic image and video content. In recent years, we have seen immense progress in this field through hundreds of publications that show different ways to inject learnable components into the rendering pipeline. This state-of-the-art report on advances in neural rendering focuses on methods that combine classical rendering principles with learned 3D scene representations, often now referred to as neural scene representations. A key advantage of these methods is that they are 3D-consistent by design, enabling applications such as novel viewpoint synthesis of a captured scene. In addition to methods that handle static scenes, we cover neural scene representations for modeling non-rigidly deforming objects...},

Practical visual localization approaches need to be robust to a wide variety of viewing conditions, including day-night changes, as well as weather and seasonal variations, while providing highly accurate six degree-of-freedom (6DOF) camera pose estimates. In this paper, we extend three publicly available datasets containing images captured under a wide variety of viewing conditions, but lacking camera pose information, with ground truth pose information, making evaluation of the impact of various factors on 6DOF camera pose estimation accuracy possible. We also discuss the performance of state-of-the-art localization approaches on these datasets. Additionally, we release around half of the poses for all conditions, and keep the remaining half private as a test set, in the hopes that this will stimulate research on long-term visual localization, learned local image features, and related research areas. Our datasets are available at visuallocalization.net, where we are also hosting a benchmarking server for automatic evaluation of results on the test set. The presented state-of-the-art results are to a large degree based on submissions to our server.},

The first is a new robust estimator MLESAC which is a generalization of the RANSAC estimator. It adopts the same sampling strategy as RANSAC to generate putative solutions, but chooses the solution that maximizes the likelihood rather than just the number of inliers. The second part of the algorithm is a general purpose method for automatically parameterizing these relations, using the output of MLESAC. A difficulty with multiview image relations is that there are often nonlinear constraints between the parameters, making optimization a difficult task. The parameterization method overcomes the difficulty of nonlinear constraints and conducts a constrained optimization. The method is general and its use is illustrated for the estimation of fundamental matrices, image–image homographies, and quadratic transformations. Results are given for both synthetic and real images. It is demonstrated that the method gives results equal or superior to those of previous approaches.},

  abstract = {Modern commodity processors such as GPUs may execute up to about a thousand of physical threads per chip to better utilize their numerous execution units and hide execution latencies. Understanding this novel capability, however, is hindered by the overall complexity of the hardware and complexity of typical workloads. In this dissertation, we suggest a better way to understand modern multithreaded performance by considering a family of synthetic workloads, which use the same key hardware capabilities – memory access, arithmetic operations, and multithreading – but are otherwise as simple as possible. One of our surprising findings is that prior performance models for GPUs fail on these workloads: they mispredict observed throughputs by factors of up to 1.7. We analyze these prior approaches, identify a number of common pitfalls, and discuss the related subtleties in understanding concurrency and Little’s Law. Also, we help to further our understanding by considering a few basic questions, such as on how different latencies compare with each other in terms of latency hiding, and how the number of threads needed to hide latency depends on basic parameters of executed code such as arithmetic intensity. Finally, we outline a performance modeling framework that is free from the found limitations. As a tangential development, we present a number of novel experimental studies, such as on how mean memory latency depends on memory throughput, how latencies of individual memory accesses are distributed around the mean, and how occupancy varies during execution.},

  abstract = {Scene understanding from images is a challenging problem encountered in autonomous driving. On the object level, while 2D methods have gradually evolved from computing simple bounding boxes to delivering finer grained results like instance segmentations, the 3D family is still dominated by estimating 3D bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to jointly infer the 3D rigid-body poses and shapes of vehicles from a stereo image pair using shape priors. Unlike previous works that geometrically align shapes to point clouds from dense stereo reconstruction, our approach works directly on images by combining a photometric and a silhouette alignment term in the energy function. An adaptive sparse point selection scheme is proposed to efficiently measure the consistency with both terms. In experiments, we show superior performance of our method on 3D pose and shape estimation over the previous geometric approach and demonstrate that our method can also be applied as a refinement step and significantly boost the performances of several state-of-the-art deep learning based 3D object detectors.

Once trained, SiamMask solely relies on a single bounding box initialisation and operates online, producing class-agnostic object segmentation masks and rotated bounding boxes at 55 frames per second. Despite its simplicity, versatility and fast speed, our strategy allows us to establish a new state of the art among real-time trackers on VOT-2018, while at the same time demonstrating competitive performance and the best speed for the semi-supervised video object segmentation task on DAVIS-2016 and DAVIS-2017.

The method identifies representative subsets of images from an unlabelled dataset based on the latent representation of a location guided autoencoder. We assess the method's sensitivities to design options using four different ground-truthed datasets of georeferenced environmental monitoring images, where these include various scenes in aerial and seafloor imagery. Efficiency gains are achieved for all the aerial and seafloor image datasets analysed in our experiments, demonstrating the benefit of the method across application domains. Compared to CNNs of the same architecture trained using conventional transfer and active learning, the method achieves equivalent accuracy with an order of magnitude fewer annotations, and 85 \% of the accuracy of CNNs trained conventionally with approximately 10,000 human annotations using just 40 prioritised annotations. The biggest gains in efficiency are seen in datasets with unbalanced class distributions and rare classes that have a relatively small number of observations.},

Obtaining effective representations from the images they collect can enable perception-aware robotic exploration such as information-gain-guided path planning and target-driven visual navigation. This letter develops a novel self-supervised representation learning method for seafloor images collected by AUVs. The method allows deep-learning convolutional autoencoders to leverage multiple sources of metadata to regularise their learning, prioritising features observed in images that can be correlated with patterns in their metadata. The impact of the proposed regularisation is examined on a dataset consisting of more than 30 k colour seafloor images gathered by an AUV off the coast of Tasmania. The metadata used to regularise learning in this dataset consists of the horizontal location and depth of the observed seafloor. The results show that including metadata in self-supervised representation learning can increase image classification accuracy by up to 15\% and never degrades learning performance. We show how effective representation learning can be applied to achieve class balanced representative image identification for summarised understanding of imbalanced class distributions in an unsupervised way.},

Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location (x,y,z) and viewing direction (θ,ϕ)) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons. Authors: Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P.

  abstract = {In recent years, image and video signals have become an indispensable part of human life. There has been an increasing demand for high quality image and video products and services. To monitor, maintain and enhance image and video quality objective image and video quality assessment tools play crucial roles in a wide range of applications throughout the �eld of image and video processing, including image and video acquisition, communication, interpolation, retrieval, and displaying. A number of objective image and video quality measures have been introduced in the last decades such as mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index (SSIM). However, they are not applicable when the dynamic range or spatial resolution of images being compared is di�erent from that of the corresponding reference images. In this thesis, we aim to tackle these two main problems in the �eld of image quality assessment. Tone mapping operators (TMOs) that convert high dynamic range (HDR) to low dynamic range (LDR) images provide practically useful tools for the visualization of HDR images on standard LDR displays. Most TMOs have been designed in the absence of a well-established and subject-validated image quality assessment (IQA) model, without which fair comparisons and further improvement are di�cult. We propose an objective quality assessment algorithm for tone-mapped images using HDR images as references by combining 1) a multi-scale signal �delity measure based on a modi�ed structural similarity (SSIM) index; and 2) a naturalness measure based on intensity statistics of natural images. To evaluate the proposed Tone-Mapped image Quality Index (TMQI), its performance in several applications and optimization problems is provided. Speci�cally, the main component of TMQI known as structural �delity is modi�ed and adopted to enhance the visualization of HDR medical images on standard displays. Moreover, a substantially di�erent approach to design TMOs is presented, where instead of using any pre-de�ned systematic computational structure (such as image transformation or contrast/edge enhancement) for tone-mapping, we navigate in the space of all LDR images, searching for the image that maximizes structural �delity or TMQI. There has been an increasing number of image interpolation and image super-resolution (SR) algorithms proposed recently to create images with higher spatial resolution from lowresolution (LR) images. However, the evaluation of such SR and interpolation algorithms is cumbersome. Most existing image quality measures are not applicable because LR and resultant high resolution (HR) images have di�erent spatial resolutions. We make one of the �rst attempts to develop objective quality assessment methods to compare LR and HR images. Our method adopts a framework based on natural scene statistics (NSS) where image quality degradation is gauged by the deviation of its statistical features from NSS models trained upon high quality natural images. In particular, we extract frequency energy fallo�, dominant orientation and spatial continuity statistics from natural images and build statistical models to describe such statistics. These models are then used to measure statistical naturalness of interpolated images. We carried out subjective tests to validate our approach, which also demonstrates promising results. The performance of the proposed measure is further evaluated when applied to parameter tuning in image interpolation algorithms.},

  abstract = {YUV is a color model typically used as part of a color image pipeline. It encodes a color image or video taking human perception into account, allowing reduced bandwidth for chrominance components, compared to a "direct" RGB-representation. Historically, the terms YUV and Y′UV were used for a specific analog encoding of color information in television systems. Today, the term YUV is commonly used in the computer industry to describe colorspaces that are encoded using YCbCr. The YUV model defines one luminance component (Y) meaning physical linear-space brightness, and two chrominance components, called U (blue projection) and V (red projection) respectively. It can be used to convert to and from the RGB model, and with different color spaces. The closely related Y′UV model uses the luma component (Y′) – nonlinear perceptual brightness, with the prime symbols (') denoting gamma correction. Y′UV is used in the PAL analogue color TV standard (excluding PAL-N). Previous black-and-white systems used only luma (Y′) information.  Color information (U and V) was added separately via a subcarrier so that a black-and-white receiver would still be able to receive and display a color picture transmission in the receiver's native black-and-white format, with no need for extra transmission bandwidth. As for etymology, Y, Y′, U, and V are not abbreviations. The use of the letter Y for luminance can be traced back to the choice of XYZ primaries. This lends itself naturally to the usage of the same letter in luma (Y′), which approximates a perceptually uniform correlate of luminance. Likewise, U and V were chosen to differentiate the U and V axes from those in other spaces, such as the x and y chromaticity space. See the equations below or compare the historical development of the math.},

  abstract = {YUV is a color model typically used as part of a color image pipeline. It encodes a color image or video taking human perception into account, allowing reduced bandwidth for chrominance components, compared to a "direct" RGB-representation. Historically, the terms YUV and Y′UV were used for a specific analog encoding of color information in television systems. Today, the term YUV is commonly used in the computer industry to describe colorspaces that are encoded using YCbCr. The YUV model defines one luminance component (Y) meaning physical linear-space brightness, and two chrominance components, called U (blue projection) and V (red projection) respectively. It can be used to convert to and from the RGB model, and with different color spaces. The closely related Y′UV model uses the luma component (Y′) – nonlinear perceptual brightness, with the prime symbols (') denoting gamma correction. Y′UV is used in the PAL analogue color TV standard (excluding PAL-N). Previous black-and-white systems used only luma (Y′) information.  Color information (U and V) was added separately via a subcarrier so that a black-and-white receiver would still be able to receive and display a color picture transmission in the receiver's native black-and-white format, with no need for extra transmission bandwidth. As for etymology, Y, Y′, U, and V are not abbreviations. The use of the letter Y for luminance can be traced back to the choice of XYZ primaries. This lends itself naturally to the usage of the same letter in luma (Y′), which approximates a perceptually uniform correlate of luminance. Likewise, U and V were chosen to differentiate the U and V axes from those in other spaces, such as the x and y chromaticity space. See the equations below or compare the historical development of the math.},

  abstract = {Visual Localization is one of the key enabling technologies for autonomous driving and augmented reality. High quality datasets with accurate 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) reference poses are the foundation for benchmarking and improving existing methods. Traditionally, reference poses have been obtained via Structure-from-Motion (SfM). However, SfM itself relies on local features which are prone to fail when images were taken under different conditions, e.g., day/ night changes. At the same time, manually annotating feature correspondences is not scalable and potentially inaccurate. In this work, we propose a semi-automated approach to generate reference poses based on feature matching between renderings of a 3D model and real images via learned features. Given an initial pose estimate, our approach iteratively refines the pose based on feature matches against a rendering of the model from the current pose estimate. We significantly improve the nighttime reference poses of the popular Aachen Day-Night dataset, showing that state-of-the-art visual localization methods perform better (up to \$47\textbackslash\%\$) than predicted by the original reference poses. We extend the dataset with new nighttime test images, provide uncertainty estimates for our new reference poses, and introduce a new evaluation criterion. We will make our reference poses and our framework publicly available upon publication.},

  abstract = {The wildlife re-identification recognition methods based on the camera trap were used to identify different individuals of the same species using the fur, stripes, facial features and other features of the animal body surfaces in the images, which is an important way to count the individual number of a species. Re-identification of wild animals can provide solid technical support for the in-depth study of the number of individuals and living conditions of rare wild animals, as well as provide accurate and timely data support for population ecology and conservation biology research. However, due to the difficulty of recording the shy wild animals and distinguishing the similar fur of different individuals, only a few papers have focused on the re-identification recognition of wild animals. In order to fill this gap, we improved the locally aware transformer (LA transformer) network structure for the re-identification recognition of wild terrestrial animals. First of all, at the stage of feature extraction, we replaced the self-attention module of the LA transformer with a cross-attention block (CAB) in order to calculate the inner-patch attention and cross-patch attention, so that we could efficiently capture the global information of the animal body’s surface and local feature differences of fur, colors, textures, or faces. Then, the locally aware network of the LA transformer was used to fuse the local and global features. Finally, the classification layer of the network realized wildlife individual recognition. In order to evaluate the performance of the model, we tested it on a dataset of Amur tiger torsos and the face datasets of six different species, including lions, golden monkeys, meerkats, red pandas, tigers, and chimpanzees. The experimental results showed that our wildlife re-identification model has good generalization ability and is superior to the existing methods in mAP (mean average precision), and obtained comparable results in the metrics Rank 1 and Rank 5.},

  abstract = {Detection Transformer (DETR) and Deformable DETR have been proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good performance as previous complex hand-crafted detectors. However, their performance on Video Object Detection (VOD) has not been well explored. In this paper, we present TransVOD, the first end-to-end video object detection system based on spatial-temporal Transformer architectures. The first goal of this paper is to streamline the pipeline of VOD, effectively removing the need for many hand-crafted components for feature aggregation, e.g., optical flow model, relation networks. Besides, benefited from the object query design in DETR, our method does not need complicated post-processing methods such as Seq-NMS. In particular, we present a temporal Transformer to aggregate both the spatial object queries and the feature memories of each frame. Our temporal transformer consists of two components: Temporal Query Encoder (TQE) to fuse object queries, and Temporal Deformable Transformer Decoder (TDTD) to obtain current frame detection results. These designs boost the strong baseline deformable DETR by a significant margin (3\%-4\% mAP) on the ImageNet VID dataset. Then, we present two improved versions of TransVOD including TransVOD++ and TransVOD Lite. The former fuses object-level information into object query via dynamic convolution while the latter models the entire video clips as the output to speed up the inference time. We give detailed analysis of all three models in the experiment part. In particular, our proposed TransVOD++ sets a new state-of-the-art record in terms of accuracy on ImageNet VID with 90.0\% mAP. Our proposed TransVOD Lite also achieves the best speed and accuracy trade-off with 83.7\% mAP while running at around 30 FPS on a single V100 GPU device.},

  abstract = {Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Its development in the past two decades can be regarded as an epitome of computer vision history. If we think of today's object detection as a technical aesthetics under the power of deep learning, then turning back the clock 20 years we would witness the wisdom of cold weapon era. This paper extensively reviews 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2019). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speed up techniques, and the recent state of the art detection methods. This paper also reviews some important detection applications, such as pedestrian detection, face detection, text detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis of their challenges as well as technical improvements in recent years.},
